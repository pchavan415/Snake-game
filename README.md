# Snake-game
Single and Double player snake game implemented in java.
There are two java files in this repository.
One is the single player snake game and another is the double player snake game.
Double player snake game is the two player game where two snake hunt for the food. The player who eats maximum food within given time will be the winnner.
One snake has arrow keys for controls, like moving up , down, left right. Another snake has w,a,s,d as the controls.
single player snake game is simple as the normal snake game but it is implemented using ACM library.
To run this java file, you should download ACM library. I have uploaded ACM in this repository.<br>
To include it in java program follow these steps-><br>
1) Start Eclipse, and locate the project folder to which this ACM library should be added.<br>
2) Right-click class folder, and select "Properties".<br>
3) Select "Java Build Path" on the left, and then the "Libraries" tab. Now, click the "Add External JARS..." button.<br>
4) Locate and select the "acm.jar" file you just downloaded, and then click "Open".<br>
5) Finally, click "OK" to close the dialog box. You will know that everything went ok if, when you open your project folder, you see an item called "Referenced Libraries", and upon expanding this item, you see the package "acm.jar" listed.<br>
